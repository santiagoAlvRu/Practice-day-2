     <p>Cordoba is the second largest city in Argentina and it has 4 million inhabitants.
        <br>
        However, it has a great advantage: nature is close by and you can enjoy the mountains, hills and rivers.

<h2>
    First steps into music
</h2>
<p>
    When I was a kid I was passionate about music, my mother let me use her headphones to listen to excellent records.
    <br>
    At home there was always a good taste for art. Here is a summary of the most listened artists in my family:

   Note: I've been trying to embed more music but I think there is a strong copyright policy between '70s and earlys 2000.

    <h2>
        First years outside Argentina
    </h2>
<p>
Around my thirties I decided to move to Spain and spent almost 3 years living there.
<br>
I fell in love with the city and the mindset of the society. I consider that Barcelona has the best balance between social life and work.
<br>
But lately is quite complicated to find a proper place to live and not spend a lot of money on rent.

        Two years ago a new adventure began. New language, new goals and challenges. 
        <br>
        That's how I ended up living in Austria and currently enjoying my life in the second district.
